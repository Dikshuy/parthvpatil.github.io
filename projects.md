I'm a second year undergraduate student persuing my electrical engineering at IIT Bombay.

I’m Parth Patil pursuing my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am in my second year. I was introduced to programming right in my childhood, and I developed a passion for it since then. I have always enjoyed Mathematics adn it in solving real-world problems. I started coding from a very young age, I built my first app in 8th grade and my first custom ROM for my android tab in 9th grade. I’m currently a part of software sub-division Team AUV-IITB. I’m also active in many Technical clubs in the institute and mostly fit in well with the community. I also recently started some work in Django foundation as part of my GSoC project.
